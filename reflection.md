Iteration 1:

Throughout this iteration the group functioned well together, proving to be a good team and a benefit rather than a deficit to our individual working ethic. Our experience was positive and only ever difficult or harsh
becuase it was the first time we had ever spoken/met each other.
Considering that this was the first time we had met, we believe that we worked very well together, as we had a high level of organisation and enthusiasm to get the work done.

Our first group meeting was online on Saturday the 28th of September. We worked over VoIP, and slack. We spoke of the Lab work and of the first iteration of the project. Just planning
at this stage.
Our second meeting was September at 12pm midday. No time of finishing was set but we worked until 3:30pm as a group. Here is where we got most of the work done, together.
Our third meeting was in class on Tuesday the 1st of October.
Because of other responsibilities we decided as a group that we will continue our project work online.

We began work by dividng the group into two sub-groups; 2 people worked on the user stories while the other 2 worked on the test functions.
We then divided the assigned work within our pairs, giving support to the other group member while doing the work individually.
As a group we had decided that this was the best way to split up responsibility of Iteration 1, so that everyone receives an equal amount of work, while at the same time making it possible to ask for help whenever needed.

Without any problems and disagreements we split up and got to work. By the end of the second meeting we had almost completed the user stories and test functions. Throughout the progression of our individually assigned work,
if any of us had any questions or problems with the topics we were working on, we would bring the problem to the group to try and solve it together. By doing this no one truly felt that any of the
work was their sole responsibility but rather the responsibility of the group.

After each persons work was completed, when given a chance, each of us would look and see what else we could contribute to the work. This worked very well, because sometimes, in group projects one person takes repsonsibility 
and dictates how everything should be done. For this Iteration, this was definently not the case. Each person definently felt like they had contributed.

As well as being very organised we felt that this structure in doing things was supportive and friendly. No one was lacking in responsibility, no one was lacking in support and no one was lacking in contribution, as everyone tried their
best.

We also set up a slack discussion group so that we could talk about the project when each member was at their own home. Throughout Iteration 1, whenever someone had any issues on the task they were assigned, they would
post it in the group chat, and we would all reply when we had a chance. This definently contributed to the feeling of being part of a group which was helpful whenever someone had any issues on their own task.

As a group it is hard to decide what kind of improvement we needed, as everyone was proactive and no one needed to be encouraged to do more work. Although, we didn't meet in person much and we feel that
if we had met in person more often than we had, we would have gotten the Iteration 1 completed earlier. This would have left us more time to do checking and to ensure that our work is correct.

If the next two Iterations go as smoothly as this iteration then as a group we could definently achieve a high-distinction for this project. So long as we also meet up regularly in
person.
