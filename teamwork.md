#  How often you met, why you met that often and what methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful:

Throughout progress on Iteration 2 our team met face-to-face formally twice. We also kept in constant contact over the internet by using the Slack appplication,
and spoke to each other over VoIP conference call.

##   We spoke on VoIP conference call on 19/10/2019
On this day we spoke about iteration 2 and lab05 as we had to complete exercise 0 in the lab which required us to talk about the project as a group. We also organised who was
responsible for each part. This was the first step of Iteration 2.

##   Our first face-to-face meeting was in class on 22/10/2019
On this day we spoke about our individual parts and the difficulties we had encountered trying to comprehend what we had to do.
We made sure to understand Iteration 2 as a group and advise each other whenever necessary. In particular, Stephen was confused about how the user/profile methods
received its input data and how we were supposed to have persistant data throughout the application. We sucessfully resolved this issue though open discussion.

##   Our second face-to-face meeting was in the K17 building on the 24/10/2019
On this day we met to complete the project together and to talk about any difficulties that we were facing. We explained what we were struggling to understand so that we could help each other. We spoke extensively about how we think the project goes together and how it is going to be programmed.

##   Methods Used to ensure our meetings were successful:
Throughout the development of the Slackr app we used the Slack application to talk to each other, so anyone could post about any difficultiess they were having. This in conjunction
with our face-to-face meetings, ensured everyone was on the same page.

We met twice face-to-face because we thought it necessary to discuss what we needed to do and how we were planning to do it. Each one of us had other commitments; either a midterm or an assignment due before iteration 2 was due.
So it was important that we found time for Iteration 2 as well as the other work we had to do. We all agreed that meeting atleast once was sufficient, as we had decided to
discuss the project over the internet.

We felt that because we were all pressed for time, when we met in person we wanted to get straight to the problem at hand. This helped us progress the project.

We used a Slack app called Daily Bot to help record our asychronous standups. Sometimes it was difficult to remember to use to Daily-Bot but our constant discussion on Slack was enough for
us to understand where each one of us was in regards to the project.

Our individual effort in the project made our meetups more valuable. Because everyone knew the problems that they were facing, when we met up everyone knew exactly what they wanted
to speak about.

#   What steps you took when things did not go to plan in Iteration 2:

During the development of Iteration 2 we faced many problems.

The first problem was initially understanding what to do. This hurdle was not too hard to solve, but we had to find a time where we were all free. With midterms and assignments due when Iteration 2 was due. We needed to find a
time when we were all free to talk about the project. We overcame this difficulty by using Slack and VoIP telephone conference.

The second problem was running issues that prevented us from doing further work;
When we had been assigned our individual work, one problem we faced was not being able to complete our task until the other person had completed theirs first. We overcame this by creating stub functions and dummy variables which we assumed would be the same format as what the other person used in their solution. This let us completed our task individually with minor
changes when the block (other person's code) was completed.

We did a lot of assumptions, assuming the output of other people's funtions according to the specs. If the output is not specified in specs we would make an agreement. This method can make sure we can still work without waiting for others to finsh their jobs.

# Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code

Much of our code needed parts of other members code to be completed first. We spoke comprehensively about how to solve many of these problems on the Slack Application.

When someone needed information about code that another member wrote then, they would ask that person for advice. When conflicts arose due to different ideas on how to code certain sections, first a discussion was held, then the Assignment specification was doubled checked to ensure that the agreed upon decision was allowed or correct depending on the situation.

We divided the work into separate categories so we would minimise context switching and merge conflicts. However we did occasionally run into merge conflicts (e.g. in server.py) which were resolved by either using common sense or through discussion on Slack.

Sometimes, we would leave the person who knows that part of code the most to do it alone, and others would review his/her work and give feedbacks.
